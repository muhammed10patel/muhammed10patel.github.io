Hello! I am Muhammed Patel I am a graduate student pursuing a MaSc in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Prior to this, I completed a dual degree program in Industrial Engineering with a specialization in Optimization at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. I am currently working on automatic whale detection and sea ice classification from SAR images. I love to stay active through calisthenics, unwind with video games, or play sports. Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow both professionally and personally.
